# dydx-simulations-streamlit
This streaemlit app uses historical simulation and Monte Carlo simulation in Python to model your liquidation risk on dYdX. The dYdX Perpetual allows traders to leverage up to 10x long or short on cryptocurrencies given there is sufficient margin in the trading account. While this leverage allows traders to earn greater rewards, it also comes with its own set of risks. A Monte Carlo simulation runs an enormous number of statistical experiments with random numbers generated from a statistical distribution. A historical simulation also runs several statistical experiments but utilises randomised historical data instead. Together, these simulations can give us a better idea of liquidation risk on dYdX.
